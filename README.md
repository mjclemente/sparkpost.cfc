# sparkpostcfc
A CFML wrapper for the Sparkpost API

This project borrows heavily from the API frameworks built by [jcberquist](https://github.com/jcberquist), such as [stripecfc](https://github.com/jcberquist/stripecfc), [xero-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/xero-cfml), and [aws-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/aws-cfml).

This is a very early stage API wrapper. Feel free to use the issue tracker to report bugs or suggest improvements!
