# This repository is no longer maintained
Just a heads up that I'm no longer developing or maintaining this project. My need for it never grew beyond its basic functionality, and now that need is gone. I'm leaving the code here in the event that someone else finds it helpful.

# sparkpostcfc
A CFML wrapper for the Sparkpost API

This project borrows heavily from the API frameworks built by [jcberquist](https://github.com/jcberquist), such as [stripecfc](https://github.com/jcberquist/stripecfc), [xero-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/xero-cfml), and [aws-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/aws-cfml).

This is a very early stage API wrapper. Feel free to use the issue tracker to report bugs or suggest improvements!
